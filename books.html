        <h2 class="card-title">The Three Questions: How to Discover and Master the Power Within You</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          The beloved spiritual teacher builds on the message of his enduring New York Times and international bestseller The Four Agreements with this profound guide that takes us deeper into the tradition of Toltec wisdom, helping us find and use the hidden power within us to achieve our fullest lives.

In The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz introduced seekers on the path to enlightenment to the tenets of Mesoamerican spiritual culture—the ancient Toltec. Now, he takes us deeper into Native American practice, and asks us to consider essential questions that drive our lives and govern our spiritual power. Three eternal questions can help us into our power and use it judiciously:

Who am I?
What is real?
How do I express love?
At each stage in our lives, we must ask these simple yet deeply profound questions. Finding the answers will open the door to the next stage in our development, and eventually lead us to our complete, truest selves. But as Don Miguel Ruiz makes clear, we suffer if we do not ask these questions—or if we fail to pay attention to their answers—because we either never act on our power or use it destructively. Only when power is anchored in our identity and in reality will it be able to be in synch with the universe—and be of true benefit to ourselves and to others.</p>

        <p class="card-text">
According to don Miguel Ruiz, everything we do is based on agreements we have made — agreements with ourselves, with other people, with God, with life. But the most important agreements are the ones we make with ourselves. In these agreements we tell ourselves who we are, how to behave, what is possible, what is impossible. One single agreement is not such a problem, but we have many agreements that come from fear, deplete our energy, and diminish our self-worth.

In The Four Agreements, don Miguel reveals the source of self-limiting agreements that rob us of joy and create needless suffering. When we are ready to change these agreements, there are four deceptively simple, yet powerful agreements that we can adopt as guiding principles. Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, the Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love.


THE FOUR AGREEMENTS:

BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD

DON’T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY

DON’T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS

ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST

Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.

The Four Agreements sound simple, even simplistic. But try keeping just one for an entire day!</p>

        <p class="card-text">
In The Voice of Knowledge, Miguel Ruiz reminds us of a profound and simple truth: The only way to end our emotional suffering and restore our joy in living is to stop believing in lies — mainly about ourselves.

Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, this breakthrough book shows us how to recover our faith in the truth and return to our own common sense. Ruiz tells us that before we learn to speak, our true nature is to love and be happy, to explore and enjoy life. As little children, we are completely authentic. Our actions are guided by instinct and emotions; we listen to the silent voice of our integrity. Once we learn a language, the people around us hook our attention and program us with knowledge. But that knowledge is contaminated with lies.

With our attention focused on all the knowledge in our head, we no longer perceive the world through the eyes of love; we only perceive what we have learned to believe. The voice of knowledge comes alive inside our head, and what is that voice telling us? Mostly lies. That voice never stops talking, judging, gossiping, and abusing us. It constantly sabotages our happiness and keeps us from enjoying a reality of truth and love.

Ruiz shows us how to recover the silent voice of our integrity and find inner peace. When the voice of knowledge no longer controls us, our life becomes an expression of our authentic self, just as it was before we learned to speak. Then we return to the truth, we return to love, and we live in happiness again.

“We are born in truth, but we grow up believing in lies. . . . One of the biggest lies in the story of humanity is the lie of our imperfection.” — don Miguel Ruiz

ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST

Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.

The Four Agreements sound simple, even simplistic. But try keeping just one for an entire day!</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">The Circle of Fire: Inspiration and Guided Meditations for Living in Love and Happiness (Prayers: A Communion with Our Creator) (Toltec Wisdom) - By don Miguel Ruiz and Janet Mills</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
In The Circle of Fire (formerly published as Prayers: A Communion With Our Creator) Ruiz inspires us to enter into a new and loving relationship with ourselves, with our fellow humans, and with all of creation.

Through a selection of beautiful essays, prayers, and guided meditations, Ruiz prepares our minds for a new way of seeing life, and opens our hearts to find our way back to our birthright: heaven on earth. The result is a life lived in joy, harmony, and contentment.

In my teachings, “The Circle of Fire” ceremony celebrates the most important day of our lives: the day when we merge with the fire of our spirit, and return to our own divinity. This is the day when we recover the awareness of what we really are, and make the choice to live in communion with that force of creation we call “Life” or “God.”  From that day forward, we live with unconditional love in our hearts for ourselves, for life, for everything in creation.

This book, first published in 2001 as “Prayers: A Communion with Our Creator,” will remind you of what you really are. It has always been my favorite book, and now in honor of my favorite prayer, it has been appropriately renamed “The Circle of Fire.”    — don Miguel Ruiz</p>

by Don Miguel Ruiz and Janet Mills </h2>
        <p class="card-text">
In The Mastery of Love, don Miguel Ruiz illuminates the fear-based beliefs and assumptions that undermine love and lead to suffering and drama in our relationships. Using insightful stories to bring his message to life, Ruiz shows us how to heal our emotional wounds, recover the freedom and joy that are our birthright, and restore the spirit of playfulness that is vital to loving relationships. The Mastery of Love includes:

Why “domestication” and the “image of perfection” lead to self-rejection
The war of control that slowly destroys most relationships
Why we hunt for love in others & how to capture the love inside us
How to finally accept and forgive ourselves and others
“Happiness can only come from inside of you and is the result of your love. When you are aware that no one else can make you happy, and that happiness is the result of your love, this becomes the greatest mastery of the Toltec:  The Mastery of Love.”  — don Miguel Ruiz</p>

        <p class="card-text">
In order to practice the Four Agreements, before we can achieve the Mastery of Love, we must move beyond fear. Fear is the source of all the negative agreements we��ve made with life, and it can alienate us from the joy that is our birthright. This comprehensive guide to the teachings of Don Miguel Ruiz includes the basic elements of Toltec wisdom and the spiritual practice that is the basis of the Four Agreements. Also included are exercises and ceremonies to walk readers through the process of shedding fear, judgment, and guilt; information on life after death, and prophecies about the evolution of humanity; and biographical information on don Miguel Ruiz and his training with his curandera mother, the famous healer, Mother Sarita. For those interested in the roots of his knowledge and his early work along the path to spiritual awakening and enlightenment, Beyond Fear provides the answers.</p>
