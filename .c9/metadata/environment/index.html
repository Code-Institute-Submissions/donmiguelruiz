Book by Barbara Emrys and Don Miguel Ruiz</h1>\n  <p class=\"lead\">The beloved spiritual teacher builds on the message of his enduring New York Times and international bestseller The Four Agreements with this profound guide that takes us deeper into the tradition of Toltec wisdom, helping us find and use the hidden power within us to achieve our fullest lives.\n\nIn The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz introduced seekers on the path to enlightenment to the tenets of Mesoamerican spiritual culture—the ancient Toltec. Now, he takes us deeper into Native American practice, and asks us to consider essential questions that drive our lives and govern our spiritual power. Three eternal questions can help us into our power and use it judiciously:\n\nWho am I?\nWhat is real?\nHow do I express love?\nAt each stage in our lives, we must ask these simple yet deeply profound questions. Finding the answers will open the door to the next stage in our development, and eventually lead us to our complete, truest selves. But as Don Miguel Ruiz makes clear, we suffer if we do not ask these questions—or if we fail to pay attention to their answers—because we either never act on our power or use it destructively. Only when power is anchored in our identity and in reality will it be able to be in synch with the universe—and be of true benefit to ourselves and to others.\n\nThe three questions provide a practical framework that allows readers to engage with Ruiz’s transformative message and act as a vehicle for overcoming fear and anxiety and discovering peace of mind. An essential guide for all travelers pursuing self-knowledge, understanding, and acceptance, The Three Questions is the next step in our unique spiritual metamorphosis.\n</p>\n  <hr class=\"my-4\">\n  <p>The three questions provide a practical framework that allows readers to engage with Ruiz’s transformative message and act as a vehicle for overcoming fear and anxiety and discovering peace of mind.

Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, The Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love.\n\n• A New York Times bestseller for over a decade.\n• Over 8.5 million copies sold in the U.S. \n• Translated into 46 languages worldwide. \n\n\"This book by don Miguel Ruiz, simple yet so powerful, has made a tremendous difference in how I think and act in every encounter.\" — Oprah Winfrey\n\n\"Don Miguel Ruiz’s book is a roadmap to enlightenment and freedom.\" — Deepak Chopra, Author, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success\n\n\"An inspiring book with many great lessons.\" — Wayne Dyer, Author, Real Magic\n\n\"In the tradition of Castaneda, Ruiz distills essential Toltec wisdom, expressing with clarity and impeccability what it means for men and women to live as peaceful warriors in the modern world.\" — Dan Millman, Author, Way of the Peaceful Warrior</p>\n  <hr class=\"my-4\">\n  <p>According to Don Miguel Ruiz, everything we do is based on agreements we have made — agreements with ourselves, with other people, with God, with life. But the most important agreements are the ones we make with ourselves. In these agreements we tell ourselves who we are, how to behave, what is possible, what is impossible. One single agreement is not such a problem, but we have many agreements that come from fear, deplete our energy, and diminish our self-worth.\n\nIn The Four Agreements,don Miguel reveals the source of self-limiting agreements that rob us of joy and create needless suffering. When we are ready to change these agreements, there are four deceptively simple, yet powerful agreements that we can adopt as guiding principles. Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, the Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love.</p>\n  <p class=\"lead\">\n    <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Four-Agreements-Practical-Personal-Freedom/dp/1878424319/ref=sr_1_1?crid=295YTEYMYWAT7&keywords=the+four+agreements+by+don+miguel+ruiz&qid=1564313028&s=gateway&sprefix=the+four%2Caps%2C250&sr=8-1\" role=\"button\">Buy Now</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"jumbotron-3\">\n  <h3 class=\"display-4\">don Miguel Ruiz with Maria Shriver</h3>\n  <img src=\"assets/images/mariashriver.png\" alt=\"don Miguel Ruiz with Maria Shriver\"> \n  <p class=\"lead\">I was thrilled to have the opportunity to sit down with bestselling author and Architect of Change Don Miguel Ruiz. - Maria Shriver</p>\n  <hr class=\"my-4\">\n  <p>In his ground-breaking new book “The Three Questions: How to Discover and Master the Power Within You,” this beloved spiritual teacher draws upon his enduring message from “The Four Agreements” with a guide that helps us to find and use the hidden power within us to achieve our fullest lives.</p>\n  <p class=\"lead\">\n    <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" href=\"https://mariashriver.com/maria-shrivers-sunday-paper-healing-nation-starts-within/\" role=\"button\">Learn more</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"jumbotron-4\">\n  <h4 class=\"display-4\">don Miguel Ruiz with his sons don Jose Ruiz (left) and don Miguel Ruiz Jr. (right)</h4>\n  <img src=\"assets/images/migueljosejr.jpg\" alt=\"don Miguel Ruiz with Sons\"> \n  <p class=\"lead\">The wisdom don Miguel has brought to the world has earned him respect around the globe.

Toltec warriors wore headdresses, chest plates, and padded armor and a small shield on one arm. They carried short swords, atlatls (a weapon designed to throw darts at high velocity) and a heavy curved bladed weapon of sorts which was a sort of cross between a club and an axe. They were organized into warrior orders representing animals such as jaguars and gods like Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca.</p>\n  <hr class=\"my-4\">\n  <p>Although the Toltecs were not on the same scale as the Ancient Maya when it comes to trade, they nevertheless did trade with their neighbors near and distant. A warrior culture, much of their incoming wealth may have been more from tribute than from trade. Seashells from both Atlantic and Pacific species were found at Tula, as well as pottery types from as far away as Nicaragua. Some pottery fragments from contemporary Gulf Coast cultures has also been identified. The Toltecs produced objects made from obsidian as well as pottery and textiles, which Toltec merchants might have used as trade goods.</p>\n  <p class=\"lead\">\n    <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" href=\"about.html\" role=\"button\">Learn more</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"jumbotron jumbotron-fluid\">\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <h1 class=\"display-4\">BOOKS</h1>\n    <p class=\"lead\">This is a modified jumbotron that occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent.</p>\n  </div>\n<div id=\"carouselExampleControls\" class=\"carousel slide\" data-ride=\"carousel\">\n  <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\n    <div class=\"carousel-item active\">\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"...\" alt=\"First slide\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"...\" alt=\"Second slide\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"...\" alt=\"Third slide\">\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <a class=\"carousel-control-prev\" href=\"#carouselExampleControls\" role=\"button\" data-slide=\"prev\">\n    <span class=\"carousel-control-prev-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\n    <span class=\"sr-only\">Previous</span>\n  </a>\n  <a class=\"carousel-control-next\" href=\"#carouselExampleControls\" role=\"button\" data-slide=\"next\">\n    <span class=\"carousel-control-next-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\n    <span class=\"sr-only\">Next</span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n  </header>\n    <footer>\n\n<div class=\"sbuttons\">\n\t\n  <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"sbutton whatsapp\" tooltip=\"WhatsApp\"><i class=\"fab fa-whatsapp\"></i></a>  \n\t  \n  <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"sbutton fb\" tooltip=\"Facebook\"><i class=\"fab fa-facebook-f\"></i></a>\n \n  <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"sbutton gplus\" tooltip=\"Google Plus\"><i class=\"fab fa-google-plus-g\"></i></a>\n \n  <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"sbutton twitt\" tooltip=\"Twitter\"><i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i></a>\n \n  <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"sbutton pinteres\" tooltip=\"Pinterest\"><i class=\"fab fa-pinterest-p\"></i></a>\n \n  <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"sbutton mainsbutton\" tooltip=\"Share\"><i class=\"fas fa-share-alt\"></i></a>\n\t  \n</div>        \n\n    </footer>\n    \n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.15.0/umd/popper.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>","undoManager":{"mark":-1,"position":-1,"stack":[]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":224,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":253,"column":8},"end":{"row":253,"column":8},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":15,"state":"start","mode":"ace/mode/html"}},"timestamp":1564329211689}
