bestselling author of The Four Agreements (a The New York Times bestseller for over 7 years , which recently topped Amazon’s #1 list after his appearance on Oprah’s Super Soul Sunday), The Mastery of Love, The Voice of Knowledge, and The Fifth Agreement (co-written with his son don Jose) . His simple yet profound teachings, based in truth, shared through his books, lectures, and journeys to sacred sites has helped millions of people worldwide transform their lives.","","Our exclusive interview with Don Miguel can be found here.","","Don Miguel Ruiz PortraitDon Miguel Ruiz was born into a humble family with ancient traditions in rural Mexico, the youngest of 13 children. He considers himself very lucky, as this was where he learned from an early age that everything is possible, if we really want it.","","His parents, Don Jose and Dona Sarita, as well as his grandfather, Don Leonardo, all believed that Miguel would continue their legacy in the centuries old Toltec tradition. Instead Don Miguel attended medical school, and became a surgeon.","","For several years he practiced neurosurgery with his brothers, and he realized that what needed to be healed was not only the physical brain, but the human mind as well.","","A near fatal car accident changed the direction of Don Miguel’s life. He experienced himself as pure awareness outside of the constraints of his physical body. He realized that the Toltec wisdom of his family contained all of the tools needed to change the human mind. Don Miguel promptly returned to his mother to finish his training and he became a Shaman.","","Don Miguel moved to the United States to share his wisdom, and spent the next 15 years exploring ways to heal and change the human mind. He witnessed his students struggling to quiet their minds and sought to create tools to assist them. The result of this quest was The Four Agreements®. This book contains a specific series of practical steps, that when used by anyone, can result in consistent and long-term personal transformation.","","In February of 2002, Don Miguel suffered a near-fatal heart attack. The damage from the heart attack and subsequent coma left him with a heart functioning at only 16% of capacity and in constant pain. Don Miguel would not accept his doctor’s prognosis that he would be restricted to an inactive life of resting at home. He personally embodied the message he shares, by continuing to joyfully live his life, sharing his message through books, lectures and journeys. Though he was enjoying life he also knew that he was slowly dying and focused on preparing his sons to carry on his legacy.","","In 2009 Don Miguel’s body began to deteriorate much more rapidly and he applied for a heart transplant. In August 2010 he was put on the transplant waiting list. On October 9th 2010, Don Miguel successfully received a heart transplant. For Don Miguel this is a new beginning and with deep gratitude and generosity he is eager to share his message with all of humanity.","","In the tradition of the Toltec, a Nagual (shaman) guides an individual to personal freedom. After exploring the human mind from a Toltec as well as scientific perspective, Don Miguel has combined old wisdom with modern insights and created a new message for all mankind, based in truth and common sense.

His simple yet profound teachings, based in truth, shared through his books, lectures, and journeys to sacred sites has helped millions of people worldwide transform their lives.","","Our exclusive interview with Don Miguel can be found here.","","Don Miguel Ruiz PortraitDon Miguel Ruiz was born into a humble family with ancient traditions in rural Mexico, the youngest of 13 children. He considers himself very lucky, as this was where he learned from an early age that everything is possible, if we really want it.","","His parents, Don Jose and Dona Sarita, as well as his grandfather, Don Leonardo, all believed that Miguel would continue their legacy in the centuries old Toltec tradition. Instead Don Miguel attended medical school, and became a surgeon.","","For several years he practiced neurosurgery with his brothers, and he realized that what needed to be healed was not only the physical brain, but the human mind as well.","","A near fatal car accident changed the direction of Don Miguel’s life. He experienced himself as pure awareness outside of the constraints of his physical body. He realized that the Toltec wisdom of his family contained all of the tools needed to change the human mind. Don Miguel promptly returned to his mother to finish his training and he became a Shaman.","","Don Miguel moved to the United States to share his wisdom, and spent the next 15 years exploring ways to heal and change the human mind. He witnessed his students struggling to quiet their minds and sought to create tools to assist them. The result of this quest was The Four Agreements®. This book contains a specific series of practical steps, that when used by anyone, can result in consistent and long-term personal transformation.","","In February of 2002, Don Miguel suffered a near-fatal heart attack. The damage from the heart attack and subsequent coma left him with a heart functioning at only 16% of capacity and in constant pain. Don Miguel would not accept his doctor’s prognosis that he would be restricted to an inactive life of resting at home. He personally embodied the message he shares, by continuing to joyfully live his life, sharing his message through books, lectures and journeys. Though he was enjoying life he also knew that he was slowly dying and focused on preparing his sons to carry on his legacy.","","In 2009 Don Miguel’s body began to deteriorate much more rapidly and he applied for a heart transplant. In August 2010 he was put on the transplant waiting list. On October 9th 2010, Don Miguel successfully received a heart transplant. For Don Miguel this is a new beginning and with deep gratitude and generosity he is eager to share his message with all of humanity.","","In the tradition of the Toltec, a Nagual (shaman) guides an individual to personal freedom. After exploring the human mind from a Toltec as well as scientific perspective, Don Miguel has combined old wisdom with modern insights and created a new message for all mankind, based in truth and common sense. He has dedicated his life to sharing this new message through practical concepts that promote transformation. His message is simple and when implemented, even incrementally, changes lives.","","Don Miguel is highly respected throughout the world.

From a very young age don Jose was guided by many teachers present in his life including, his mother and father, his grandmother Sarita, and several other Naguals. Through masterful guidance by his teachers and amazing life experiences with precision synchronicity, Jose came to 'silent knowledge'; he witnessed the world as it is, without any story. In his early twenties, don Jose lost his eyesight. In his process of surrendering, he learned the value of learning to listen; to listen to his inner wisdom and integrity and to see different perspectives, while knowing nothing is personal. He had a renewed love and gratitude for life ~ and he found acceptance, happiness and abundance; he found bliss. He grasped a true understanding of faith, love, gratitude and humility. Through his surrender and faith, in concert with modern medicine Jose recovered his eyesight.","","Like his father, combining new insights with ancient wisdom, don Jose Ruiz is dedicating his life to sharing the ancient Toltec wisdom by translating it into practical, everyday life concepts that promote transformation through truth, love and common sense. don Jose teaches and lectures across the United States and around the world: Power Journeys to the pyramids of Teotihuacan, Palenque, Tulum and Coba; workshops with guest don Miguel or other teachers at Omega ­ NY, Austin, and Vancouver.","","don Jose Ruiz has now collaborated with his father don Miguel Ruiz on a new book that offers a fresh perspective on the Four Agreements, and a powerful new agreement for transforming our lives into our personal heaven: The Fifth Agreement.","","The Fifth Agreement takes us to a deeper level of awareness of the power of the Self, and returns us to the authenticity we were born with.

The Circle of Shadows is a collective of artists that formed in 2008, inspired by the dream of different voices coming together to share a common message of truth. Although geographically dispersed, the various members of the collective gather to create, record and tour.

His simple yet profound teachings, based in truth, shared through his books, lectures, and journeys to sacred sites has helped millions of people worldwide transform their lives.","","Our exclusive interview with Don Miguel can be found here.","","Don Miguel Ruiz PortraitDon Miguel Ruiz was born into a humble family with ancient traditions in rural Mexico, the youngest of 13 children. He considers himself very lucky, as this was where he learned from an early age that everything is possible, if we really want it.","","His parents, Don Jose and Dona Sarita, as well as his grandfather, Don Leonardo, all believed that Miguel would continue their legacy in the centuries old Toltec tradition. Instead Don Miguel attended medical school, and became a surgeon.","","For several years he practiced neurosurgery with his brothers, and he realized that what needed to be healed was not only the physical brain, but the human mind as well.","","A near fatal car accident changed the direction of Don Miguel’s life. He experienced himself as pure awareness outside of the constraints of his physical body. He realized that the Toltec wisdom of his family contained all of the tools needed to change the human mind. Don Miguel promptly returned to his mother to finish his training and he became a Shaman.","","Don Miguel moved to the United States to share his wisdom, and spent the next 15 years exploring ways to heal and change the human mind. He witnessed his students struggling to quiet their minds and sought to create tools to assist them. The result of this quest was The Four Agreements®. This book contains a specific series of practical steps, that when used by anyone, can result in consistent and long-term personal transformation.","","In February of 2002, Don Miguel suffered a near-fatal heart attack. The damage from the heart attack and subsequent coma left him with a heart functioning at only 16% of capacity and in constant pain. Don Miguel would not accept his doctor’s prognosis that he would be restricted to an inactive life of resting at home. He personally embodied the message he shares, by continuing to joyfully live his life, sharing his message through books, lectures and journeys. Though he was enjoying life he also knew that he was slowly dying and focused on preparing his sons to carry on his legacy.","","In 2009 Don Miguel’s body began to deteriorate much more rapidly and he applied for a heart transplant. In August 2010 he was put on the transplant waiting list. On October 9th 2010, Don Miguel successfully received a heart transplant. For Don Miguel this is a new beginning and with deep gratitude and generosity he is eager to share his message with all of humanity.","","In the tradition of the Toltec, a Nagual (shaman) guides an individual to personal freedom. After exploring the human mind from a Toltec as well as scientific perspective, Don Miguel has combined old wisdom with modern insights and created a new message for all mankind, based in truth and common sense. He has dedicated his life to sharing this new message through practical concepts that promote transformation. His message is simple and when implemented, even incrementally, changes lives.","","Don Miguel is highly respected throughout the world. He has received numerous recognitions, including a US Air Force challenge coin engraved with The Four Agreements, and he is referenced as a National Heirloom of Mexico.","","The Four Agreements®, published in 1997; was a New York Times bestseller for more than 7 years and the 36th bestselling book of the decade. Other books have followed; The Mastery of Love, The Voice of Knowledge, Prayers, Beyond Fear and The Fifth Agreement, a collaboration with his son Don Jose. All of his books are international bestsellers.</p>","</div>","","<div class=\"jumbotron jumbotron-fluid\">","<div class=\"row\">","<div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-4\">","<img src=\"assets/images/aboutpicture3.jpg\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"Responsive image\">","</div>","<div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-4\">","<img src=\"assets/images/donmiguelruizJR.jpg\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"Responsive image\">","</div>","<div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-4\">","<img src=\"assets/images/aboutpicture4.jpg\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"Responsive image\">","</div>","</div>","</div>","<div class=\"jumbotron jumbotron-fluid\">","<h2>don MIGUEL RUIZ JR.</h2>","<p>At the age of 14, don Miguel Ruiz Jr. apprenticed to his father don Miguel Sr. and his grandmother, Madre Sarita. From that early age, he was called upon to translate Madre Sarita's prayers, lectures and workshops from Spanish into English. In this way, through constant repetition and review, he learned the content of her teachings in both languages.","","Through interpreting for Madre Sarita, don Miguel Jr. came to understand the power of faith. He saw first-hand how she manifested her intent to heal people, both physically and spiritually.","","don Miguel Jr.'s apprenticeship lasted 11 years. When he reached his mid-20's, his father intensified his training. At the apex of this power journey don Miguel said to his eldest son, \"Find your way out. Go home and master Death by becoming alive.\"","","For the past thirteen years, don Miguel Jr. has applied the lessons learned from his father and grandmother to define and enjoy his own personal freedom while achieving peace with all of creation.","","Today, don Miguel Jr. is married and has two young children. And so, as a Nagual he begins once again to pass along the wisdom and the tools of his family's traditions in helping others to achieve their own personal freedom and optimal physical and spiritual health.","","Miguel Jr. has taken the lessons of his father and grandmother and discovered his own personal freedom. Being able to apply his teachings to the world around him gave Miguel Jr. a new understanding of the lessons his father and grandmother had passed onto him, once again giving him the desire to pass on his beliefs. He is the author of the books: “The Five Levels of Attachment”, “Living a Life of Awareness”, “The Mastery of Self”, and “The Don Miguel Ruiz’s Little Book of Wisdom”. He also co-authored the book, “The Seven Secrets to Healthy, Happy Relationships” with his dear friend, HeatherAsh Amara. After decades of training, Miguel Jr. was finally ready to share everything he had learned. As a Nagual, he now helps others discover optimal physical and spiritual health, so that they may achieve their own personal freedom.</p>","</div>","","<div class=\"jumbotron jumbotron-fluid\">","<div class=\"row\">","<div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-4\">","<img src=\"assets/images/aboutpicture5.jpg\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"Responsive image\">","</div>","<div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-4\">","<img src=\"assets/images/joseruiz.jpg\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"Responsive image\">","</div>","<div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-4\">","<img src=\"assets/images/aboutpicture6.jpg\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"Responsive image\">","</div>","</div>","</div>","<div class=\"jumbotron jumbotron-fluid\">","<h2>don JOSE RUIZ</h2>","<p>don Jose Ruiz","was born in Mexico City, Mexico and was raised in Tijuana, Mexico. When he was 21 he came to live in the U.S. with his father, don Miguel Ruiz. From a very young age don Jose was guided by many teachers present in his life including, his mother and father, his grandmother Sarita, and several other Naguals. Through masterful guidance by his teachers and amazing life experiences with precision synchronicity, Jose came to 'silent knowledge'; he witnessed the world as it is, without any story. In his early twenties, don Jose lost his eyesight. In his process of surrendering, he learned the value of learning to listen; to listen to his inner wisdom and integrity and to see different perspectives, while knowing nothing is personal. He had a renewed love and gratitude for life ~ and he found acceptance, happiness and abundance; he found bliss. He grasped a true understanding of faith, love, gratitude and humility. Through his surrender and faith, in concert with modern medicine Jose recovered his eyesight.","","Like his father, combining new insights with ancient wisdom, don Jose Ruiz is dedicating his life to sharing the ancient Toltec wisdom by translating it into practical, everyday life concepts that promote transformation through truth, love and common sense. don Jose teaches and lectures across the United States and around the world: Power Journeys to the pyramids of Teotihuacan, Palenque, Tulum and Coba; workshops with guest don Miguel or other teachers at Omega ­ NY, Austin, and Vancouver.","","don Jose Ruiz has now collaborated with his father don Miguel Ruiz on a new book that offers a fresh perspective on the Four Agreements, and a powerful new agreement for transforming our lives into our personal heaven: The Fifth Agreement.","","The Fifth Agreement takes us to a deeper level of awareness of the power of the Self, and returns us to the authenticity we were born with. In this compelling sequel to The Four Agreements, we are reminded of the greatest gift we can give ourselves: the freedom to be who we really are.","","The Universe of Now is an exciting project created by Don Jose Ruiz. Use the Universe of NOW to become inspired and enjoy each moment, by living in the NOW. Become more aware of what inspires or un-inspires you, and practice to become an amazing artist of life.","","One of don Jose’s newest passions is his band Circle of Shadows. The Circle of Shadows is a collective of artists that formed in 2008, inspired by the dream of different voices coming together to share a common message of truth. Although geographically dispersed, the various members of the collective gather to create, record and tour. In 2009, the group released their first studio album, don Jose Ruiz and The Circle of Shadows, a CD combining music with inspiring words and original artwork. The collective currently includes Jose Ruiz (author and Shaman), Greg Beaton (musician, producer and voice actor), Joe Gasparik (musician and producer), Aaron Landman (visual artist and video
