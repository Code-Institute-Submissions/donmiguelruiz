Now, he takes us deeper into Native American practice, and asks us to consider essential questions that drive our lives and govern our spiritual power. Three eternal questions can help us into our power and use it judiciously:","","Who am I?","What is real?","How do I express love?","At each stage in our lives, we must ask these simple yet deeply profound questions. Finding the answers will open the door to the next stage in our development, and eventually lead us to our complete, truest selves. But as Don Miguel Ruiz makes clear, we suffer if we do not ask these questions—or if we fail to pay attention to their answers—because we either never act on our power or use it destructively. Only when power is anchored in our identity and in reality will it be able to be in synch with the universe—and be of true benefit to ourselves and to others."],"id":2}],[{"start":{"row":86,"column":13},"end":{"row":86,"column":14},"action":"remove","lines":[">"],"id":3},{"start":{"row":86,"column":12},"end":{"row":86,"column":13},"action":"remove","lines":["p"]},{"start":{"row":86,"column":11},"end":{"row":86,"column":12},"action":"remove","lines":["/"]},{"start":{"row":86,"column":10},"end":{"row":86,"column":11},"action":"remove","lines":["<"]},{"start":{"row":86,"column":8},"end":{"row":86,"column":10},"action":"remove","lines":["  "]},{"start":{"row":86,"column":6},"end":{"row":86,"column":8},"action":"remove","lines":["  "]},{"start":{"row":86,"column":4},"end":{"row":86,"column":6},"action":"remove","lines":["  "]},{"start":{"row":86,"column":2},"end":{"row":86,"column":4},"action":"remove","lines":["  "]},{"start":{"row":86,"column":0},"end":{"row":86,"column":2},"action":"remove","lines":["  "]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":29},"end":{"row":86,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["",""]}],[{"start":{"row":85,"column":28},"end":{"row":85,"column":29},"action":"remove","lines":[">"],"id":4},{"start":{"row":85,"column":27},"end":{"row":85,"column":28},"action":"remove","lines":["\""]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":26},"end":{"row":85,"column":27},"action":"remove","lines":["t"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":25},"end":{"row":85,"column":26},"action":"remove","lines":["x"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":24},"end":{"row":85,"column":25},"action":"remove","lines":["e"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":23},"end":{"row":85,"column":24},"action":"remove","lines":["t"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":22},"end":{"row":85,"column":23},"action":"remove","lines":["-"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":21},"end":{"row":85,"column":22},"action":"remove","lines":["d"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":20},"end":{"row":85,"column":21},"action":"remove","lines":["r"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":19},"end":{"row":85,"column":20},"action":"remove","lines":["a"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":18},"end":{"row":85,"column":19},"action":"remove","lines":["c"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":17},"end":{"row":85,"column":18},"action":"remove","lines":["\""]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":16},"end":{"row":85,"column":17},"action":"remove","lines":["="]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":15},"end":{"row":85,"column":16},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":14},"end":{"row":85,"column":15},"action":"remove","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":13},"end":{"row":85,"column":14},"action":"remove","lines":["a"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":12},"end":{"row":85,"column":13},"action":"remove","lines":["l"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":11},"end":{"row":85,"column":12},"action":"remove","lines":["c"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":10},"end":{"row":85,"column":11},"action":"remove","lines":[" "]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":9},"end":{"row":85,"column":10},"action":"remove","lines":["p"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":8},"end":{"row":85,"column":9},"action":"remove","lines":["<"]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":6},"end":{"row":85,"column":8},"action":"remove","lines":["  "]},{"start":{"row":85,"column":4},"end":{"row":85,"column":6},"action":"remove","lines":["  "]}],[{"start":{"row":85,"column":2},"end":{"row":85,"column":4},"action":"remove","lines":["  "],"id":5},{"start":{"row":85,"column":0},"end":{"row":85,"column":2},"action":"remove","lines":["  "]},{"start":{"row":84,"column":104},"end":{"row":85,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["",""]}],[{"start":{"row":134,"column":154},"end":{"row":153,"column":94},"action":"remove","lines":["","        <p class=\"card-text\">","According to don Miguel Ruiz, everything we do is based on agreements we have made — agreements with ourselves, with other people, with God, with life.

Ruiz tells us that before we learn to speak, our true nature is to love and be happy, to explore and enjoy life. As little children, we are completely authentic. Our actions are guided by instinct and emotions; we listen to the silent voice of our integrity. Once we learn a language, the people around us hook our attention and program us with knowledge. But that knowledge is contaminated with lies.","","With our attention focused on all the knowledge in our head, we no longer perceive the world through the eyes of love; we only perceive what we have learned to believe. The voice of knowledge comes alive inside our head, and what is that voice telling us? Mostly lies. That voice never stops talking, judging, gossiping, and abusing us. It constantly sabotages our happiness and keeps us from enjoying a reality of truth and love.","","Ruiz shows us how to recover the silent voice of our integrity and find inner peace. When the voice of knowledge no longer controls us, our life becomes an expression of our authentic self, just as it was before we learned to speak. Then we return to the truth, we return to love, and we live in happiness again.","","“We are born in truth, but we grow up believing in lies. . . .
