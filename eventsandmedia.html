Experience Living the Four Agreements with don Miguel Ruiz Jr and don Jose Ruiz

In the bestselling book the Four Agreements, don Miguel Ruiz gives us the principles that can transform our life into an expression of unconditional love. By discovering the source of our self-limiting beliefs that rob us of joy and create needless suffering in our life, we can then shift our perception with that awareness by applying a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new expression of freedom, true happiness and love. The code of conduct is the Four Agreements:

The First Agreement – Be Impeccable with your word

The Second Agreement – Don’t Take Anything Personally

The Third Agreement – Don’t Make Assumptions

The Fourth Agreement – Always do your best

Based on the family’s Toltec wisdom, the Ruiz brothers will share how to apply “The Four Agreements” in our everyday life as an instrument of transformation in this interactive experience. Thus, allowing us to co-create a mutual understanding within the group of each agreement, including the Fifth Agreement- Be Skeptical, But Learn to listen in a way that reflects our personal life. From this point of view, the presentation will be a formless organic experience, as the questions and interactive engagement with those in attendance and will create the foundation of a new dream where unconditional love is not a definition but an experience we can manifest in our life.

- Discover the underlying wisdom of The Four Agreements, and why they have the power to rapidly transform your life to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love

- Learn a proven technique to challenge the fear-based beliefs that rob you of happiness and keep you from living the life you really want to live

- Deepen your understanding and practice of The Four Agreements by expanding your awareness of the broader teachings of don Miguel Ruiz

- Empower your life with “impeccable” communication and improve your relationships with everyone – including yourself

        <p>Welcome to “The Four Agreements for a Better Life!” My name is Janet Mills, and I’m the publisher and co-author, with don Miguel Ruiz, of six books in The Toltec Wisdom Series.


Twenty-three years ago, I had the great pleasure of meeting don Miguel through a mutual friend who encouraged me to attend a power journey in Teotihuacan, Mexico. I found don Miguel’s teachings to be unique, authentic, and life-transforming. At that time, he expressed his desire and vision to reach people all around the world with his powerful and beautiful message.

Our association over the years has resulted in a series of books including The Four Agreements, The Four Agreements Companion Book, The Mastery of Love, The Voice of Knowledge, The Circle of Fire, and The Fifth Agreement (with don Jose Ruiz). This extraordinary body of work has been published in 46 languages around the world, and the overwhelmingly positive response has inspired me to create an online course as a way to encourage people to deepen their understanding and practice of The Four Agreements.

“The Four Agreements for a Better Life” online course not only incorporates the wisdom within the entire Toltec Wisdom Series, but it’s designed to bring greater awareness to the power and magic of The Four Agreements as a life-transforming code of conduct. When practiced with commitment and a true desire to live a better life, The Four Agreements replace conflict, drama, and needless emotional suffering with happiness, personal freedom, love, and respect for one’s ”self” and all life.

If you have never read The Four Agreements, or any other book in The Toltec Wisdom Series, the online course will be an introduction to the teachings of Ruiz, and a valuable opportunity for you to open your eyes, your heart, and your imagination to the many gifts that embracing this wisdom will bring into your life. I invite and encourage you to join our growing community of people committed to creating a better life for themselves and ultimately a better world for all of us.

Live by The Four Agreements. Live a better life!

Janet Mills

        <p>"When we bring our attention back to discovering who we are on the inside—not who we wish we were or who we think we should be—we begin a sacred path of transformation toward our innate, authentic, embodied power."

My Journey
In 1973 my parents took my sister and me to India. We went as tourists to touch the luminous beauty of the Taj Mahal and to be touched by the immense contrasts of poverty, chaos, devotion, and peace that pervade India. I was seven years old.

Earlier that year I had decided to write a book, but when I sat down to start my bestseller, a sudden aha moment gave me pause. Sitting there at my wooden desk with my pad of lavender paper and my favorite black felt-tip pen in hand, I realized I was missing one crucial ingredient to be an author:

Experience.

So I put away my paper and pen and went outside to play. I implicitly trusted that what I needed to write my book would come. And in a few months the many experiences I would eventually write about began with a life-altering, four-second event.

The catalyst for this awakening came in a package of an Indian child who was about my age. I was walking down a dusty New Delhi street holding my dad’s hand. I remember the heavy, sticky heat, looking down and worrying that my white sandals were going to get dirty, looking back up again into the eyes of a young girl walking toward me.

She was barefoot, draped in a soiled fragment of a dress, all elbows and knees. I almost looked away, embarrassed by my clean dress, shiny shoes, and full belly. But as we came closer our gaze stayed connected. Everything around me stopped. The noise of the traffic dissolved. The fear I hadn’t realized I was holding evaporated. As I looked deeply into her brown eyes a warm sun radiated out from her heart. Every cell in my being smiled in utter happiness, and utter happiness and recognition were reflected back to me in her smile.

And then we passed. I felt as if I had reunited with my best friend after many long years of separation. But the feeling did not dissolve after our paths crossed; it only grew stronger. I was ecstatic, like I’d been dipped in liquid beauty. Everything around me became a sweet song I suddenly remembered how to sing.

What I learned in that seconds-long merging, and that I’ve forgotten and re-remembered many times since that day, is that within each of us, regardless of our circumstances, resides a clear pool of joy and an unbreakable connection to our wholeness.

        <h4 id="section1"><strong>Don Miguel Ruiz Jr and don Jose Ruiz:</strong></h4>
        <p>don Miguel Ruiz has two sons - don Miguel Ruiz Jr. and don Jose Ruiz, who are both renowned authors and spiritual teachers like their father. don Miguel Ruiz Jr.
At the age of 14, don Miguel Jr. apprenticed to his father don Miguel Sr. and his grandmother, Madre Sarita. From that early age, he was called upon to translate Madre Sarita’s prayers, lectures and workshops from Spanish into English. In this way, through constant repetition and review, he learned the content of her teachings in both languages. Through interpreting for Madre Sarita, don Miguel Jr. came to understand the power of faith. He saw first-hand how she manifested her intent to heal people, both physically and spiritually. don Miguel Jr.’s apprenticeship lasted 10 years. When he reached his mid-20’s, his father intensified his training. At the apex of this power journey don Miguel said to his eldest son, “Find your way out. Go home and master Death by becoming alive.” 
 don Jose Ruiz
was born in Mexico City, Mexico and was raised in Tijuana, Mexico. When he was 21 he came to live in the U.S. with his father, don Miguel Ruiz. From a very young age don Jose was guided by many teachers present in his life including, his mother and father, his grandmother Sarita, and several other Naguals. Through masterful guidance by his teachers and amazing life experiences with precision synchronicity, Jose came to 'silent knowledge'; he witnessed the world as it is, without any story. In his early twenties, don Jose lost his eyesight. In his process of surrendering, he learned the value of learning to listen; to listen to his inner wisdom and integrity and to see different perspectives, while knowing nothing is personal. He had a renewed love and gratitude for life ~ and he found acceptance, happiness and abundance; he found bliss. He grasped a true understanding of faith, love, gratitude and humility. Through his surrender and faith, in concert with modern medicine Jose recovered his eyesight.</p>
